## Ringer Feature

### From “Unknown Caller” To Answered Call
 Nearly 90% of consumers don’t answer calls from unknow numbers.
With more than 50.5 billion robocalls made in 2021, can you blame them?

- Problem 1:
To help protect consumers from telephone fraud, the FCC says, “Don't answer calls from unknown numbers.” And people don’t.
- Problem 2:
Because of this, consumers are missing important calls – appointment reminders, school closures, flight delays, test results and more.
- Problem 3:
Scammers, spoofers and fraudsters have made it nearly impossible for legitimate businesses to connect with customers.

- Problem 4:
Even though consumers consider the phone their channel of choice, they don’t trust it.

## Calls Aren’t Just Answered, They’re Resolved.
Branded calls help increase answer rates, but Ringer Interactive goes beyond branded with full-screen, personalized messages.

Ringer’s patented Interactive Caller ID™ automatically delivers each customer a personalized call-to-action. Customers see the reason for your call while the phone is ringing and can then easily resolve issues such as appointment confirmations, subscription renewals and more. What used to take several unanswered calls and call-backs can now be done through one personalized, branded call.
